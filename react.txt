1.What is React.js?
React.js is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. It focuses on component-based development and provides a declarative approach to building UIs.

2.What are the key features of React.js?
JSX syntax for defining components
Virtual DOM for efficient DOM manipulation
Component-based architecture
Unidirectional data flow
React Hooks for state management and side-effects

3.Explain the difference between React and Angular.
React is a JavaScript library primarily used for building UI components, whereas Angular is a full-fledged framework for building large-scale applications.
React uses a virtual DOM for efficient updates, while Angular uses two-way data binding.
React promotes a component-based architecture, while Angular follows an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.

4.What is JSX?
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript, which allows you to write HTML elements in JavaScript code. It provides a more concise and readable way to define UI components in React.

5.What are components in React?
Components are the building blocks of React applications. They are reusable, independent, and encapsulated pieces of UI that can be composed together to form complex UIs. Components can be either functional or class-based.

6.What are props in React?
Props (short for properties) are a way of passing data from parent to child components in React. They are read-only and are used to customize the behavior or appearance of a component.

7.What are state and setState() in React?
State is a built-in object in React that represents the current condition or data of a component. It is mutable and managed internally by the component. setState() is a method used to update the state of a component, triggering a re-render of the component and its children.

8.What is the significance of keys in React lists?
Keys are special attributes used by React to identify unique elements in a list of components. They help React efficiently update the UI by minimizing the number of DOM manipulations when the list changes.

9.Explain the concept of Virtual DOM.
Virtual DOM is a lightweight in-memory representation of the actual DOM. React uses it to perform efficient updates to the UI. When state or props of a component change, React calculates the difference between the current virtual DOM and the new one, and only updates the real DOM with the necessary changes.

10.What is the difference between state and props in React?
State is mutable and managed within the component, while props are immutable and passed from parent to child components. State is used for internal component state management, while props are used to pass data from parent to child components.

11.What is the purpose of setState() in React.js?
setState() is a method used to update the state of a component in React.js. When setState() is called, React.js re-renders the component and its children with the updated state. It is the primary way to trigger UI updates in React.js.

12.What is the difference between a functional component and a class component in React?
Functional components are simple JavaScript functions that accept props as an argument and return React elements. They are preferred for simple UI components.
Class components are ES6 classes that extend the React.Component class. They have additional features such as state and lifecycle methods.
