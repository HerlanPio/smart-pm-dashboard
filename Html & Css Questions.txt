1. What is HTML?
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is the language of the internet. It is the standard text formatting language used for creating and displaying pages on the Internet

HTML documents are made up of the elements and the tags that format it for proper display on pages.

2. What are HTML tags?
We use HTML tags for placing the elements in the proper and appropriate format. Tags use the symbols <, and > to set them apart from the HTML content.

The HTML tags need not be closed always. For example, in the case of images, the closing tags are not required as <img> tag.

3. What are HTML Attributes?
Attributes are the properties that can be added to an HTML tag. These attributes change the way the tag behaves or is displayed. For example, a <img> tag has an src attribute, which you use to add the source from which the image should be displayed.

We add attributes right after the name of the HTML tag, inside the brackets. We can only add the attributes to opening or self-closing tags, but never be in closing tags.

4. How do you separate a section of texts in HTML?
We separate a section of texts in HTML using the below tags:

<br> tag – It is used to separate the line of text. It breaks the current line and shifts the flow of the text to a new line.
<p> tag–This tag is used to write a paragraph of text.

5. Define the list types in HTML?
The list types in HTML are as below:

Ordered list–The ordered list uses <ol> tag and displays elements in a numbered format.
Unordered list–The unordered list uses <ul> tag and displays elements in a bulleted format.

6. How do you align list elements in an HTML file?
We can align the list elements in an HTML file by using indents. If you indent each nested list in further than the parent list, you can easily align and determine the various lists and the elements that it contains.

7. Differentiate between an Ordered list and an Unordered list?
An unordered list uses <ul> </ul> tags and each element of the list is written between <li> </li> tags. The list items are displayed as bullets rather than numbers.

An ordered list uses <ol> </ol> tags and each element of the list is written between <li> </li> tags. The list items are displayed as numbers rather than bullet points.

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

  <body>

    <h2>HTML List Example</h2>

    <ul>

      <li>Coffee</li>

      <li>Tea</li>

      <li>Milk</li>

    </ul>

    <ol>

      <li>Coffee</li>

      <li>Tea</li>

      <li>Milk</li>

    </ol>

  </body>

</html>


8. What is an element in HTML?
An element in HTML is a set of tags that define a specific part of a web page. It consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag.

9. What is the difference between HTML and CSS?
HTML is used to create the structure and content of a web page, while CSS is used to define the appearance and layout of the page.

No, HTML tags are used to define the structure of a web page, while HTML elements are made up of a set of tags that define a specific part of a web page.

11. What are void elements in HTML?
Void elements in HTML are tags that do not require a closing tag. They are used to insert images, line breaks, and other content that does not require additional information.

12. What is the advantage of collapsing white space?
Collapsing white space in HTML can help to reduce the size of web pages and make them load faster. It involves removing unnecessary white space between HTML elements.

13. What are HTML Entities?
HTML Entities are special characters used to represent characters that cannot be typed on a keyboard. They are often used to display special symbols and foreign characters.

14. How do you display a table in an HTML webpage?

The HTML <table> tag is used to display data in a tabular format. It is also used to manage the layout of the page, for example, header section, navigation bar, body content, footer section. Given below are the list of HTML tags used for displaying a table in an HTML webpage:

Tag

Description

<table>

It defines a table.

<tr>

It defines a row in a table.

<th>

It defines a header cell in a table.

50 pcs  100  500
10 pcs  5    50

The HTML Code for the problem depicted above is:

<table>

  <tr>

    <td>50 pcs</td>

16. How do we insert a comment in HTML?
We can insert a comment in HTML by beginning with a lesser than sign and ending with a greater than sign. For example, “<!-“ and “->.”


17. What is white space in HTML?
An empty sequence of space characters is called the white space in HTML. This white space is considered as a single space character in the HTML.

White space helps the browser to merge multiple spaces into one single space, and so taking care of indentation becomes easier. White space helps in better organizing the content and tags, making them readable and easy to understand.

18. How do you create links to different sections within the same HTML web page?
We use the <a> tag, along with referencing through the use of the # symbol, to create several links to different sections within the same web page.

19. How do you create a hyperlink in HTML?
We use the anchor tag <a> to create a hyperlink in HTML that links one page to another page. The hyperlink can be added to images too. 

20. Why do we use a style sheet in HTML?
A style sheet helps in creating a well-defined template for an HTML webpage that is both consistent as well as portable. We can link a single style sheet template to various web pages, which makes it easier to maintain and change the look of the website.

21. What is semantic HTML?
Semantic HTML is a coding style. It is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics or meaning of the content. 

For example: In semantic HTML <b> </b> tag is not used for bold statement as well as <i> </i> tag is not used for italic. Instead of these we use <strong></strong> and <em></em> tags.

22. What would happen if there is no text between the HTML tags?
There would be nothing to format if there is no text present between the tags. Therefore, nothing will appear on the screen. 

Some tags, such as the tags without a closing tag like the <img> tag, do not require any text between them.

23. How do you create nested web pages in HTML?
Nested web pages basically mean a webpage within a webpage. We can create nested web pages in HTML using the built-in iframe tag. The HTML <iframe> tag defines an inline frame. For example:

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

  <body>

    <h2>HTML Iframes example</h2>

    <p>

      specify the size of the iframe using the height and width attributes:

    </p>

    <iframe src="https://simplilearn.com/" height="600" width="800"></iframe>

  </body>

</html>

24. How do you add buttons in HTML?

  </body>

</html>

27. What is the alt attribute in HTML?
The alt attribute is used for displaying a text in place of an image whenever the image cannot be loaded due to any technical issue.

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

  <body>

    <h2>HTML Alt Example</h2>

    <img src="tulip.jpeg" alt="Tulip Garden" />

    <p style="color: Green">Line 2</p>

  </body>

</html>

30. How do you add CSS styling in HTML?
There are three ways to include the CSS with HTML:

Inline CSS: It is used when less amount of styling is needed or in cases where only a single element has to be styled. To use inline styles add the style attribute in the relevant tag.
External Style Sheet: This is used when the style is applied to many elements or HTML pages. Each page must link to the style sheet using the <link> tag:
<head>

  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css" />

</head>

Internal Style Sheet: It is used when a single HTML document has a unique style and several elements need to be styled to follow the format. Internal styles sheet is added in the head section of an HTML page, by using the <style> tag:
<head>

  <style type="text/css">

    hr {

      color: sienna;

    }

    p {

      margin-left: 20px;

    }

    body {

      background-image: url("images/back40.gif");

    }

  </style>

</head>

31. What hierarchy do the style sheets follow?
If a single selector includes three different style definitions, the definition that is closest to the actual tag takes precedence. Inline style takes priority over embedded style sheets, which takes priority over external style sheets.

32. How do you add JavaScript to an HTML webpage?
JavaScript is used for making HTML web pages more interactive, and user-friendly. It is a scripting language that allows you to interact with certain elements on the page, based on user input. As with CSS, there are three major ways of including JavaScript:

Inline:
You can add JavaScript to your HTML elements directly whenever a certain event occurs. We can add the JavaScript code using attributes of the HTML tags that support it. Here is an example that shows an alert with a message when the user clicks on it:

<button onclick="alert('Click the Button!');">

Click!

</button>

Script block:
You can define a script block anywhere on the HTML code, which will get executed as soon as the browser reaches that part of the document. This is why script blocks are usually added at the bottom of HTML documents.

<html>

  <script>

    var x = 1;

    var y = 2;

    var result = x + y;

    alert("X + Y is equal to " + result);

  </script>

</html>

External JavaScript file:
You can also import the JavaScript code from a separate file and keep your HTML code clutter-free. This is especially useful if there is a large amount of scripting added to an HTML webpage.

<html>

  <script src="my-script.js"></script>

</html>

33. What are the different types of lists in HTML?
There are three lists in HTML: ordered, unordered, and definition. Ordered lists are numbered lists, unordered lists are bulleted lists, and definition lists are lists of terms and their definitions.

34. What is the ‘class' attribute in HTML?
The ‘class' attribute in HTML defines a class for an HTML element. It can be used to apply a specific style to a group of elements on a web page.

35. What is the difference between the ‘id' and ‘class' attributes of HTML elements?
The ‘id' attribute defines a unique identifier for an HTML element, while the ‘class' attribute defines a class for a group of elements. An ‘id' can only be used once on a page, while a ‘class' can be used multiple times.

36. What is the difference between HTML and XHTML?
HTML and XHTML are both markup languages used to create web pages. However, XHTML is stricter than HTML and requires developers to write well-formed code that adheres to specific rules and guidelines. XHTML also requires all tags to be closed and all attributes to be quoted.

37. What is the difference between HTML and HTML5?
HTML5 is the latest version of HTML and includes new features and improvements over previous versions. Some key differences between HTML and HTML5 include support for multimedia elements (such as video and audio), improved semantics, and better support for mobile devices.

38. What is the role of the <head> tag in HTML?
The <head> tag defines information about the web page that is not displayed on the page itself, such as its title, keywords, and other metadata. It is located between the <html> and <body> tags and is usually the first element in the document.

39. What is the role of the <meta> tag in HTML?
The <meta> tag provides additional information about the web page, such as the author, description, and keywords. It is located within the <head> section of the HTML document.

40. What is the role of the alt attribute in HTML?
The alt attribute provides alternative text for an image in case the image cannot be displayed. This is important for accessibility, as screen readers can read the alt text to describe the image to visually impaired users.

41. What is the role of the title attribute in HTML?
The title attribute provides additional information about an element, such as a link or an image. The title text is displayed as a tooltip when a user hovers over the element.

42. What is a form in HTML?
A form is a set of input fields and other elements to collect user data. Forms can be used for various purposes, such as logging in, submitting feedback, or purchasing.

43. What are the different types of form input fields in HTML?
Several form input fields in HTML include text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, select menus, and text areas. Each input field type is used to collect different types of data from users.

44. What is the role of the action attribute in HTML forms?
The action attribute is used to specify the URL of the script or program that will process the data submitted by the form. When the user clicks the submit button, the form data is sent to the specified URL for processing.

45. What is the role of the method attribute in HTML forms?
The method attribute is used to specify the HTTP method that will be used to submit the form data. The two most common methods are GET and POST. GET is used to retrieve data from the server, while POST is used to send data to the server

46. In how many ways can you display HTML elements?
HTML elements can be displayed in several ways, including block, inline, inline-block, and none. The display property can specify how an element should be displayed.

47. What is the difference between “display: none” and “visibility: hidden” when used as attributes to the HTML element?
The main difference between “display: none” and “visibility: hidden” is that the former removes the element from the document flow, while the latter simply hides it. Elements with “display: none” are not visible and do not take up any space on the page, while elements with “visibility: hidden” are not visible but still take up space.

48. How to specify the link in HTML and explain the target attribute?
Links can be specified using the <a> tag. The href attribute is used to specify the URL of the page that the link should go to. The target attribute can specify where the linked page should open, such as in a new or similar window.

49. In how many ways can we specify the CSS styles for the HTML element?
CSS styles can be specified in several ways, including inline, internal, and external stylesheets. Inline styles are applied directly to the HTML element using the style attribute. Internal styles are defined within the <head> section of the HTML document using the <style> tag. External stylesheets are defined in a separate CSS file and linked to the HTML document using the <link> tag.

50. What is the difference between link tag <link> and anchor tag <a>?
The <link> tag links external resources, such as CSS stylesheets, to an HTML document. The <a> tag creates links to other pages or resources within the same document.

51. When to use scripts in the head and when to use scripts in the body?
Scripts can be placed in the <head> section of the HTML document or in the <body> section. Scripts that must be executed before the page is displayed, such as scripts that define variables or functions, should be placed in the <head> section. Scripts that must be executed after the page is displayed, such as scripts that manipulate the DOM, should be placed in the <body> section.

52. What are forms, and how to create forms in HTML?
Forms collect user data, such as login information or search queries. Forms can be created using the <form> tag, and input fields, such as text fields and checkboxes, can be added using various other tags.
