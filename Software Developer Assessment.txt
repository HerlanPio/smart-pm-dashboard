Original Text: (Implied lack of explicit image placement instructions in relation to the text)

Notes: Without an actual layout, it's hard to specify exact alignment. However, the image clearly signifies "Contact Us." Its best use would be as an interactive button or a visual cue directly associated with the contact information provided. If this is part of a web page, ensure the image is responsive and maintains its alignment across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) using appropriate CSS properties (e.g., float, flexbox, grid, margin, padding). Avoid hardcoding margin-left values if trying to center or align, and instead use container properties.
